## üìã Project Overview

This project was developed during my **AI/ML Internship at Edunet Foundation** to predict employee burnout risk using machine learning algorithms. The system analyzes various workplace and personal factors to provide early warnings about potential burnout, helping organizations take proactive measures to maintain employee well-being.

## üéØ Objective

To develop a predictive model that can identify employees at risk of burnout based on workplace factors, enabling organizations to:
- **Prevent burnout** before it occurs
- **Improve employee retention** and satisfaction
- **Create healthier work environments**
- **Reduce organizational costs** associated with employee turnover

## üìä Dataset Information

The dataset contains employee information with the following features:

| Feature | Description | Data Type | Range/Values |
|---------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Employee ID** | Unique identifier for each employee | String | e.g., fffe390032003000 |
| **Date of Joining** | Employee's joining date | DateTime | e.g., 2008-12-30 |
| **Gender** | Employee's gender | Categorical | Male/Female |
| **Company Type** | Type of organization | Categorical | Service/Product |
| **WFH Setup Available** | Work from home availability | Categorical | Yes/No |
| **Designation** | Employee's job level | Numerical | 0.0 - 5.0 (higher = senior) |
| **Resource Allocation** | Daily working hours | Numerical | 1.0 - 10.0 |
| **Mental Fatigue Score** | Employee's mental fatigue level | Numerical | 0.0 - 10.0 (0=no fatigue, 10=extreme) |
| **Burn Rate** | **Target Variable** - Burnout risk score | Numerical | 0.0 - 1.0 (higher = more burnout risk) |

## üîß Features Used for Prediction

After data preprocessing and cleaning, the following features are used:

1. **Gender** - Employee's gender (Male/Female)
2. **Company Type** - Service or Product company
3. **WFH Setup Available** - Remote work availability (Yes/No)
4. **Designation** - Job level/seniority
5. **Daily Working Hours** - Number of hours worked per day
6. **Mental Fatigue Score** - Current mental fatigue level (0.0-10.0)
7. **Company Tenure** - Years of experience with the company

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** - Core programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Flask** - Web framework
- **HTML5 & CSS3** - Frontend development
- **Render** - Deployment platform

## üìà Model Performance

### **Algorithms Compared**
| Model | R¬≤ Score | Performance |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Linear Regression** ‚úÖ | **0.92** | **Best Performance** |
| Random Forest Regressor | < 0.92 | Outperformed by Linear Regression |

### **Final Model Selection**
- **Algorithm Used**: **Linear Regression**
- **R¬≤ Score**: **0.92** (Excellent predictive accuracy)
- **Model Choice Rationale**: Linear Regression outperformed Random Forest, demonstrating that employee burnout has strong linear relationships with the selected features
- **Validation**: Cross-validation confirmed consistent performance across different data splits
## üéØ Key Insights

### **Model Performance Insights**
- **Linear Regression superiority**: Despite being a simpler algorithm, Linear Regression achieved **92% accuracy**, outperforming Random Forest
- **Linear relationships**: The strong performance of Linear Regression indicates that employee burnout has clear linear correlations with workplace factors
- **Feature importance**: Mental fatigue score, working hours, and company tenure show strong predictive power

### **Burnout Risk Patterns**
- Employees with **higher mental fatigue scores** show significantly increased burnout risk
- **Longer working hours** correlate strongly with burnout probability
- **Work-from-home availability** reduces burnout risk
- **Company tenure** shows interesting patterns in burnout prediction
